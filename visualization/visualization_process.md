# Visualization Process

## Tools Used
- Google BigQuery (data extraction using SQL)
- Google Sheets (data visualization)

## Data Flow
1. Data was queried and aggregated using SQL in BigQuery.
2. Query results were exported to Google Sheets.
3. Visualizations were created based on aggregated data.

## Visualizations Created
- Total number of rides by user type (member vs casual)
- Average ride duration by user type
- Ride distribution by day of the week
- Comparison of usage patterns between members and casual riders

## Purpose of Visualizations
The visualizations support the identification of behavioral differences between user types,
helping to inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
